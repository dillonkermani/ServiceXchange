# ServiceXchange 
### Overview
ServiceXchange is a free-to-use, centralized service network connecting service providers from a wide variety of disciplines with recurrent customers. The ServiceXchange platform allows anyone to easily request or provide a service whether it be a babysitting gig, a grocery delivery driver, handyman, or online consultant. Think of a Yelp(ified) Rolodex. Intuitive search features, a data-rich MapView, and an interactive client-to-provider messaging system will allow clients to create a network of trusted service providers they can rely on making it a go-to app for anyone looking for, or offering, local or remote freelancing opportunities.

### Example Use Case
Steve is a landlord with multiple rental properties and is responsible for resolving issues any of his houses may have. Before using ServiceXchange, Steve had to find and connect with workers by various means, painstakingly searching around the internet for reputable, but affordable, services, and often waiting in long phone queues to talk to a dispatcher. Steve needed a centralized platform to quickly notify any one of his several plumbers, electricians, landscapers, cleaners, or handymen. ServiceXchange allows Steve to quickly find reputable laborers in his local area, and if satisfied with their ServiceXchange reviews and history, request their services. Reconnecting with a previous worker is as easy as checking your ‘Service History’, selecting the worker, and sending them a message. Now instead of managing the phone numbers and email addresses of the service providers he needs, he can find and reach out to any of his manual laborers, babysitters, or IHSS providers all from the same app.
